# Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor: Workshop

## Instructors names and contact information

* Robert A. Amezquita, robert.amezquita@fredhutch.org
* Stephanie C. Hicks, shicks19@jhu.edu


## Workshop Description

TBD

## Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Familiarity with high-throughput gene expression data as obtained from RNA-seq

Relevant background reading:

* [@OSCA]


## Workshop Participation

Students will be able to run code interactively during the workshop on their personal computers during a live demonstration of the code used herein, with ample opportunity for questions, answers, and discussion.


## _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

* TBD: url here


## Time outline

1 hour workshop consisting of the following:

| Activity                              | Time |
|---------------------------------------|------|
| TBD                                   | TBDm |


## Workshop goals and objectives

### Learning goals

* Describe the framework needed to implement a basic single-cell RNA-seq analysis
* Describe the utility and design of the *SingleCellExperiment* object in the context of the analysis framework
* Identify critical steps within a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis that can greatly influence end-results
* Understand the differences between single-cell vs. bulk based technologies, and the advantages/disadvantages of each


### Learning objectives

* Import single-cell RNA-seq data from raw counts into a *SingleCellExperiment* object
* Utilize the *SingleCellExperiment* object for annotation, subsetting, and processing via ad-hoc and established methods
* Produce descriptive plots from *SingleCellExperiment* objects to evaluate key quality control and processing steps
