# Workshop Description

This workshop gives an introductory overview of analyzing single-cell data, particularly RNA-seq, using Bioconductor software. This workshop will help participants to understand essential Bioconductor infrastructure, such as the *SingleCellExperiment* class, and various analytical routines using real-world data. Finally, this workshop is modeled after the manuscript *"Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor"* (Amezquita et al. 2019). Students will analyze provided example datasets on their personal laptop. This workshop will be a mixture of example code shown by instructors (available through this repository) and short exercises.

## Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Familiarity with high-throughput gene expression data as obtained from RNA-seq

## Workshop Participation

Execution of example code and hands-on practice

## _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

* TBD: url here

## Time outline

1 hour workshop consisting of the following:

| Activity                              | Time |
